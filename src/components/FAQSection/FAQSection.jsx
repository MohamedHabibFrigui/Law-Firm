            <h3>How will I know which attorney in the group is best for me?</h3>
            <p>
              Our leadership team at the Thurman Law firm will determine which
              attorney can best represent you in handling your case. It may not
              be possible, or advantageous, to have one attorney handle all of
              your legal matters of the case, but from time to time.

            <p>
              No one can stop a lawsuit from being filed. However, if there is a
              legitimate dispute that arises and a claim made against you,
              consult a lawyer behind-the-scenes work is being completed so that
              on the day your matter is ready, nothing will be overlooked.

              What is the difference between divorce and legal separation?
            </h3>
            <p>
              In addition to ending your marriage, a divorce addresses all
              issues within the marriage, including property, finances, and
              child-related issues. This is the most common way to deal with
              marital issues, as Florida does not recognize legal separation.

            <h3>Why should I have a lawyer representing me during divorce?</h3>
            <p>
              While many individuals proceed through the divorce process, having
              the help of an attorney with family law experience can go a long
              way toward protecting your interests. Floridaâ€™s family laws have
              developed over many decades and are complicated.

            <h3>Do I need an attorney to start a business?</h3>
            <p>
              There are certain matters that are fairly straightforward or not
              unduly difficult to learn and, therefore, do not require the
              services of an attorney, like writing a business plan, researching
              and picking a name for your business or reserving a domain.
